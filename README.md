## Design Choices

### Fonts

I have used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to find a text that best suits the feel of the website. For the main text I have chosen [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=mon "Montserrat font") as I find it easy to read. To make the headers and the navigation bar distinct the text, I used [Roboto Slab](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Slab?query=rob "Roboto Slab font"). This font gives the desired distinction between text and headers.

### Icons

I will use some icons for my website from the [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). Icons used will be styled and will fit in with the appearance of the website.

### Colours

I have used [Colourmind](https://colormind.io/ "colourmind") to aid in the selection of the colour scheme. I selected the initial colour that I wanted the reast of my pallet to fit with and then used the generator to create the pallet, it can be seen INSERT WIREFRAMES ETC. DISCUSS ANY ISSUES WITH COLOUR SELECTION HERE. IF CONTRASTS ETC FAIL TESTS INLCUDE HERE WITH WIREFRAMES. THEN DISCUSS HOW YOU HAD AN EFFECTIVE PALLETTE

I will explain the uses of the varius colours below, starting from top to bottom.

INSERT IMAGE OF COLOUR PALETTE THEN LIST AND DESCRIBE COLOURS

- #8C00B3 - This colour will be used as a background colour for sections and as a text colour.
- #FFFDDF - This colour will be used as a background colour for sections and as a text colour.
- #8E689B - This colour will be used on the contact form for added styling.
- #92579F - This colour will be used as a backgroung behind any images used.
- #121A18 - This colour will be used as a text colour also the navigation and footer background colour.

# Wireframes

I have used [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/ "Balsamic") to develop the wireframes for this website. I began with a mobile version which was scaled up for tablet and desktop. I used a one page design so that the user can easily scroll through the information.

The wireframes are below:

### [Desktop Wireframe](INCLIUDE LIKNK HERE "Desktop wireframe")

### [Tablet Wireframe](INCLUDE LINK HERE "Tablet wireframe")

### [Phone Wireframe](INCLUDE LINK HERE "Phone wireframe")
